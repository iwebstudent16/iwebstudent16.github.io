                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <div class="date">7/18/19</div>
                <p>This week we fixed last minute errors. Some students submitted their UI designs and prototypes so
                    they could get awards.
                    We also made logos on Adobe Illustrator. Finally, we did a quick review of what we did this summer.
                    We had an award ceremony
                    at the final class to celebrate everyone'sweb sites and designs.</p>

                <div class="date">7/12/19</div>
                <p>This week we added fancybox to our websites. We went outside and took some of our own photos. We also
                    learned about thumbnails. We drew logos too. Now we only have one more week of Summer School!</p>

                <div class="date">7/5/19</div>
                <p>This week we continued using Adobe XD to finish our prototypes. The last two days of the week I was
                    browsed Codepen. This week was pretty fun.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">6/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week I learned how to use Adobe Xd, Ai, and Ps. I made a prototype of my website. I added the
                    link of <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fc05302d-8b18-4639-55cf-c7ca97d94e7e-8a34/">my
                        prototype</a>
                    to my website. I wonder what I will do next week! </p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>I deleted all of the styling (CSS) that I did last week, and started adding essential HTML and CSS,
                    such as common structual markup (like header,
                    nav, footer, etc.). I was originally sad about deleting our CSS that we did in week 1. I also
                    created three category-based lists as the content of my home page. I then
                    created two sub pages: about.html and blog.html. After a lot of hard work, I had a like working web
                    site with three pages: <a href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>I learned how to make a live website hosted on Github. On Github, I created a root username
                    repository
                    named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent16/iwebstudent16.github.io">iwebstudent16.github.io.</a>
                    This was a technical week. At the end of the week, I had a live, working web
                    site: <a href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io">https://iwebstudent16.github.io.</a></p>
