                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>I deleted all of the styling (CSS) that I did last week, and started adding essential HTML and CSS,
                    such as common structual markup (like header,
                    nav, footer, etc.). I was originally sad about deleting our CSS that we did in week 1. I also
                    created threecategory-based lists as the content of my home page. I then
                    created two sub pages: about.html and blog.html. After a lot of hard work, I had a like working web
                    site with three pages: <a href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>I learned a live website hosted on Github. On Github, I created a root username repository named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent16/iwebstudent16.github.io">iwebstudent16.github.io.</a>
                    This was a technical week. At the end of the week, I had a live, working web
                    site: <a href="https://iwebstudent16.github.io">https://iwebstudent16.github.io</a></p>
